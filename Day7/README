I implemented two solutions:
- brute force in Python;
- brute force in C, works with both parts just by changing the #DEFINE on top;
- particle swarm optimization in Octave using my experimental algorithm (my undergrad's thesis, work in progress), which at the moment works with hard coded parameters.
